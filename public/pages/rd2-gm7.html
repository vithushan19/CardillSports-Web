            I’m not much of a superstitious guy. I don’t believe in any 416-curse, or that you as a fan can directly affect the outcome of the game with your actions. You deciding to watch the game from your basement has as much impact on the game as the decision to take a nap or post a Facebook status. I’m more of a numbers guy. I believe in analyzing the cold hard facts. With that let’s take a look at the recent events leading up to tonight’s extremely important game 7.
